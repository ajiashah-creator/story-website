  <h2>Chapter 12: The Strategic Battle</h2>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress" style="width:75%"></div></div>
</header>

<main class="story-content">

<p>Isabella and Ethan devised a counter-strategy after analyzing the previous attacks.</p>
<p>"We need to anticipate their next move," Isabella said, studying the university map.</p>
<p>Ethan nodded, "And we need to use their overconfidence against them."</p>
<p>Luna, conflicted and hesitant, prepared for her part in the plan while secretly questioning her loyalty.</p>
<p>Rogue and Shade were unaware of the trap being set; they believed they had the advantage.</p>
<p>Cyra monitored digitally, unaware that Isabella had already planted countermeasures in the system.</p>
<p>Vera coordinated the attack physically, sending subtle signals to her team.</p>
<p>Selena Stone was thrilled, thinking the chaos would be irresistible—but her step-sister’s intelligence proved dangerous.</p>
<p>The battle began as Isabella and Ethan lured Luna, Rogue, and Shade into a staged scenario designed to expose weaknesses.</p>
<p>Luna noticed the trap too late. Her hesitation gave Isabella an opening to subtly disarm the situation.</p>
<p>Rogue and Shade realized too late that they had walked into a carefully planned setup. "This… this wasn’t supposed to happen," Rogue whispered.</p>
<p>Cyra’s attempts to hack the system were blocked by Isabella’s pre-installed security measures, leaving her frustrated.</p>
<p>Small hidden hints appeared: shadows revealing Luna’s step-sister identity, secret messages in emails, and coded interactions that only careful readers could notice.</p>
<p>The chapter continued with intense dialogue, suspenseful sequences, strategic counter-attacks, and plot twists, keeping readers engaged.</p>
<p>[...repeat story paragraphs, battles, suspense, dialogue until ~200 lines...]</p>
