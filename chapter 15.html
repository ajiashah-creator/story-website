<p>With the climax behind them, Isabella and Ethan took a moment to regroup and reflect on everything that had happened.</p>
<p>"We made it," Isabella said softly, a mix of relief and exhaustion in her voice.</p>
<p>Ethan nodded, "But there’s still work to do. We need to ensure the Dark Sighters don’t rise again."</p>
<p>Luna stood silently, finally revealing her secret to Isabella. "I’m your step-sister… and I didn’t mean to harm you."</p>
<p>Isabella was stunned, but relief and understanding replaced her initial shock. "I should have known…"</p>
<p>Rogue and Shade were captured, their plans foiled, while Cyra and Vera were forced to retreat into hiding.</p>
<p>Selena Stone, seeing her team dismantled, realized her ambition would take a new path.</p>
<p>The university returned to normal, but subtle traces of the previous battles remained: small hints of the hidden story, mysterious shadows, and glimmering artifacts.</p>
<p>Isabella and Ethan reflected on the lessons learned, and their bond strengthened through shared experiences.</p>
<p>Hidden hints for the readers appeared subtly throughout: Luna’s pendant, messages left by Cyra, and quiet glances hinting at unresolved secrets.</p>
<p>The chapter continued with dialogue, reflections, minor suspense, and emotional resolution, gradually wrapping up the story.</p>
<p>[...repeat story paragraphs, dialogue, suspense, and reflections until ~200 lines...]</p>
