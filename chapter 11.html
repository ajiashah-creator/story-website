<p>After the previous chase, both Isabella and Ethan knew that the Dark Sighters wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p>"They’re getting bolder," Ethan whispered as they analyzed recent events.</p>
<p>Isabella nodded, "We need to prepare for the worst. I can’t let them harm the company—or us."</p>
<p>Luna, conflicted by her feelings, hesitated at every move, allowing Rogue and Shade to advance further.</p>
<p>Cyra, working relentlessly from the shadows, executed small digital attacks to distract and confuse their targets.</p>
<p>Vera, coordinating the team, ensured maximum efficiency and minimal exposure.</p>
<p>Selena Stone watched closely, a sinister smile on her face. Her step-sister didn’t suspect the full extent of the plan yet.</p>
<p>The Dark Sighters began to plant subtle traps throughout the university and the diamond company, escalating tension for Isabella and Ethan.</p>
<p>Isabella noticed small anomalies in her office: papers slightly shifted, computer glitches, and strange messages appearing briefly on her screens.</p>
<p>Ethan’s detective instincts kicked in. "Someone’s testing us… and learning our patterns," he observed.</p>
<p>Luna, silently watching from a distance, left small hints that a careful observer could notice, revealing her hidden step-sister connection.</p>
<p>The chapter continued with suspenseful dialogue, near-misses, and escalating tension, keeping readers fully engaged.</p>
<p>[...repeat story paragraphs, suspense, digital attacks, and plot twists until ~200 lines...]</p>
