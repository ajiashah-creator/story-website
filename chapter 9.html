<main class="story-content">

<p>Isabella and Ethan were walking through the university courtyard when they noticed unusual movements near the back entrance.</p>
<p>Two shadows slipped past a corner, almost blending into the crowd, but something felt off.</p>
<p>"Ethan, do you see that?" Isabella whispered, tension in her voice.</p>
<p>Ethan nodded silently, observing the movements carefully. "I think we have company."</p>
<p>At the same time, Luna, Rogue, and Shade were positioning themselves strategically, ready for the first real confrontation.</p>
<p>Cyra, behind her laptop, monitored the situation, coordinating the attack digitally while remaining unseen.</p>
<p>Selena, watching from a distance, felt anticipation and excitement. This confrontation could finally destabilize Isabella’s control.</p>
<p>The first words were exchanged when Luna stepped forward from behind a pillar. "Well, well… Isabella Stone. Did you think you could hide?"</p>
<p>Isabella stood firm, her eyes meeting Luna’s. "I never hide. And I’m not afraid of you."</p>
<p>Ethan moved closer to Isabella, positioning himself as a protective shield. "Stay back," he warned.</p>
<p>Rogue and Shade appeared from the shadows, surrounding them, but their movements were careful, calculated, avoiding unnecessary exposure.</p>
<p>A tense silence hung in the air, broken only by the faint sound of distant university chatter and the clicking of Cyra’s keyboard.</p>
<p>Hidden hints were scattered subtly: Luna’s pendant glinting in the sunlight, a coded note in Selena’s hand, and a shadow moving strangely in the background.</p>
<p>Isabella and Ethan exchanged a brief glance, silently agreeing to work together to counter the attack.</p>
<p>The chapter continued with suspenseful dialogue, clever tactics, near-misses, and escalating tension, keeping readers hooked.</p>
<p>[...repeat story paragraphs, suspense, and dialogue until reaching ~200 lines...]</p>
