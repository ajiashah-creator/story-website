<p>The day was bright, but a shadow loomed over the university and the diamond company alike.</p>
<p>Luna, perched on the rooftop, prepared her sniper rifle. Her target: Isabella Stone, unaware of the imminent danger.</p>
<p>Rogue and Shade moved quietly through the university, ensuring no one would interfere with the plan.</p>
<p>Cyra monitored Isabella’s schedule and location, giving Luna real-time updates.</p>
<p>Vera directed the operation, making sure every member of Dark Sighters was in position.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ethan Black was walking through the courtyard, oblivious to the sniper on the roof.</p>
<p>Isabella was presenting her business project to a class when the first signs of danger appeared— a sudden flicker of shadow over the window.</p>
<p>Ethan noticed a glint reflecting from the rooftop. His detective instincts kicked in instantly.</p>
<p>"Watch out!" Ethan shouted, grabbing Isabella and pushing her behind a desk just as Luna pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>The bullet missed, hitting the wall with a deafening crack.</p>
<p>Luna, shocked that someone intervened, retreated temporarily, retreating into the shadows.</p>
<p>Rogue and Shade realized the attack had failed; tension rose among the Dark Sighters.</p>
<p>Cyra cursed softly at her monitor. "How did he know?!" she muttered.</p>
<p>Hidden hints appeared throughout the chapter: a small emblem on Luna’s jacket, a photo in Selena’s bag, coded text in Cyra’s laptop.</p>
<p>Selena, observing from a distance, smirked. Her step-sister’s life was in danger, but her plan had not fully succeeded yet.</p>
<p>Isabella, shaken but unharmed, looked at Ethan. "Who are you really?" she asked, sensing his alertness.</p>
<p>Ethan smiled wryly. "Just someone who doesn’t like people shooting at you."</p>
<p>The chapter continued with detailed story paragraphs, dialogue, suspense, and small twists...</p>
