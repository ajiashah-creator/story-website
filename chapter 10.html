<p>After the first confrontation, Isabella and Ethan realized they had to move fast. The Dark Sighters were relentless.</p>
<p>"We can’t stay here," Ethan whispered, scanning the area for escape routes.</p>
<p>Isabella nodded. "Let’s split up for a bit, confuse them."</p>
<p>Luna, Rogue, and Shade began pursuing them through the campus, moving like shadows among the students.</p>
<p>Cyra monitored their movements digitally, giving instructions through encrypted channels.</p>
<p>Selena Stone, watching secretly, couldn’t help but smirk. "This will be interesting," she murmured.</p>
<p>The chase wound through hallways, courtyards, and hidden tunnels beneath the university.</p>
<p>Isabella used her sharp instincts to stay one step ahead, while Ethan relied on his detective skills to anticipate the villains’ moves.</p>
<p>Every corner turned was a new challenge. Rogue almost cornered Isabella, but she dodged with a clever trick.</p>
<p>Luna aimed from a distance but hesitated, conflicted by her hidden feelings for her step-sister.</p>
<p>Shade tried to intercept Ethan, but he cleverly maneuvered through crowded areas, keeping both of them safe.</p>
<p>Hidden hints appeared along the way: a pendant swinging from Luna’s jacket, small notes from Cyra, and mysterious shadows flickering in the distance.</p>
<p>Despite the chaos, Isabella and Ethan found moments to communicate silently, sharing strategies and relying on each other’s strengths.</p>
<p>The chapter continued with suspenseful dialogue, near-misses, and thrilling twists, keeping readers engaged throughout.</p>
<p>[...repeat story paragraphs, chase sequences, suspense, dialogue until reaching ~200 lines...]</p>
